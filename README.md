# Visulization-of-Climate-Change
This is a reaction-able dashboard , to visualize that indivuals` small changes could make a huge difference on this global issue. The project is developed with Python, altair and streamlit. Project for A Course.
## Data
The attached csv is collected from[9] and processed, which is the future temperatures.

The specific dataset used was also very different from the original idea. I referenced My Carbon Footprint [4] and used data
sources for food [5], electricity [6], and other emissions [7], all from trusted organisations. Data on global temperatures were
obtained from NOAA National Centers for Environmental information [8].
It is worth noting that using carbon emissions to estimate the impact on future temperatures is probably the trickiest part of
the project. This part of the data involves a lot of formulae, details of which can be found in [9].
